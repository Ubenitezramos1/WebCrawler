Our project is a multi-threaded web crawler is an advanced script that utilizes multiple threads to concurrently 
fetch and process web pages, significantly improving efficiency and speed.

Input: The user is prompted to enter a URL to start crawling
Output: The program scrapes through each URL (if they haven't been visited before) using threads from a pool of threads and concurrently 
    outputs the list of URLs

How to Run the crawler: VsCode is recommended
    - Download the zip file if you haven't already
    - Add the Folder to a new java project in VsCode
    - To run the WebCrawler.java file, you need the appropriate libraries
    - Under Java Projects, click on referenced libraries and add the jsoup-1.16.2.jar file 
    - Run the WebCrawler.java code and enter your preferred URL in the correct format in the terminal (Ex: https://en.wikipedia.org/)
    - To stop the code in terminal, press Ctrl+C (works with Mac and Windows)
